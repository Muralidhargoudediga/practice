/**
 * Algorithm:
 * 
 * Querying length of longest is fairly easy. Note that we are dealing with end
 * elements only. We need not to maintain all the lists. We can store the end
 * elements in an array. Discarding operation can be simulated with replacement,
 * and extending a list is analogous to adding more elements to array.
 * 
 * We will use an auxiliary array to keep end elements. The maximum length of
 * this array is that of input. In the worst case the array divided into N lists
 * of size one (note that it doesâ€™t lead to worst case complexity). To discard
 * an element, we will trace ceil value of A[i] in auxiliary array (again
 * observe the end elements in your rough work), and replace ceil value with
 * A[i]. We extend a list by adding element to auxiliary array. We also maintain
 * a counter to keep track of auxiliary array length.
 * 
 * 1. If A[i] is smallest among all end candidates of active lists, we will
 * start new active list of length 1.
 * 
 * 2. If A[i] is largest among all end candidates of active lists, we will clone
 * the largest active list, and extend it by A[i].
 * 
 * 3. If A[i] is in between, we will find a list with largest end element that
 * is smaller than A[i]. Clone and extend this list by A[i]. We will discard all
 * other lists of same length as that of this modified list.
